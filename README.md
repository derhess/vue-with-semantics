## vue-with-semantics
Playground and testing out vue with microformats and maybe some other semantic formats

For more than two years, I am observing the Indie Web Community and it use of semantic data within webmentions. Several times my wordpress theme and my limited wordpress skills caused problems parsing my website data. I already thought about to solve this issue very easily with templates or VueJS Renderless Components, but in the end this twitter conversation kicked my ass

However, now I try to add semantic data via Renderless VueJS Component approach to my HTML. I don't know it this will work out. Code is highly experimental! Don't use it! Only for discussions!
